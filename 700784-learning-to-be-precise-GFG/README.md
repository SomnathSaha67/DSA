## Easy
There are times when your answer is a floating point that contains undesired amount of digits after decimal. 
Here, we'll learn how to get a precise answer out of a floating number. You are given two floating numbers a and b. 
You need to print the value of a/b rounded to exactly 3 decimal places.

You may use library precision methods.
You need to print the result (return type is void) without any spaces around it.

Example:
Input: a = 5.43, b = 2.653
Output: 2.047
Explanation: The exact result of a / b is approximately 2.04674. When rounded to 3 decimal places, it becomes 2.047.
Input: a = 10.0, b = 3.0
Output: 3.333
Explanation: 10 / 3 = 3.33333... → Rounded to 3 decimal places = 3.333
Constraints:1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100
